Welcome to guess the number game, a very easy and quick start game for new user.
This is a game were the player have to guess the correct number, maybe 
between 0 to 5 or 1 to 10...depend on what stage. And in each stage the player have 
some amount of trials to keep guessing, and if he run out of trial the correct number

## Features
#### Do you already have an account
This is the first board of the game. This section require to you to select either Y or N to know if
you are already an existing user or not, If Y..then it ask you to input your username and passowrd, then 
a welcome back message will be print to the terminal. But if N, you have to sign up to become a user.

#### Initializing...! Starting game in process...
This section is a quick one, I thought this was also interesting to add some more flexible functionalities
to the game from the little experience i have as i keep growing to be better with python. This section doesn't
require for a second sign up but only ask for your sign up name.

#### Loading Game...
Another functionality that i also thought that would make sense, was to also add a loading game seconds 
before the game start as the user prepare. This section is a countdown seconds from 10 to 0, then the main game begins.

#### I?m think of a number from 0 to 5
This section is the very beginning of the game after users input or log in or sign up. With this very
beginning the user have 2 trials to guess the number correct, and if he get it wrong, on the terminal, there will 
be printed out how many trials left and he will have to try again, and if he run out of trials, on the terminal, there will
be printed out the random number. That how each stage of the game goes till he plays to the end.
